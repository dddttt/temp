rows maps to objects
table maps to the class

delete vs destroy
=================

associations
============

* primary key, foreign key
* has many, belongs to
* add associations dynamically define new methods
* a meal type has many dishes, a dish belongs to a meal type


MVC
====

* model view controller
* make a strong separation between presentation and domain model
* controller and view should not talk to each other mostly
* domain element we refer to as a model
* model objects are completely ignorant of the user interface
* controller take user input and figure out what to do with it
* view the presentation / web html / json / mobile app
