* diversity seeding creativity
* what is failure? giving up is the biggest failure
* responsibility, a bit more hard working, 

* leader vs follower
* skill will always be follower stronger otherwise hired the wrong person
* can accept loss
* preserverence - can take rejections and failures

* never try to unite people's beliefs, unite under the same goal

* attitude is more important then ability, choice is also more important then ability
